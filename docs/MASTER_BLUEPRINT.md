# MERCHANTMIND — MASTER PRODUCT & ARCHITECTURE BLUEPRINT

**Platform:** MerchantMind (Intelligent Financial Operating System & Decision Support Platform)  
**Target:** Hackathon Presentation & Serious B2B Fintech SaaS  
**Version:** 1.0.0-alpha (Frontend-First Architecture)  
**Primary Persona:** Alok Kumar — *Alok Mobile Shop* (Retail Electronics & Telecom Accessories, Lucknow/Delhi)  
**Currency:** INR (₹)  

---

## 1. PRODUCT VISION
MerchantMind eliminates the merchant's daily cognitive burden of spreadsheet wrangling, manual Khata reconciliations, and metric guesswork. 
Instead of a passive reporting dashboard ("Upload CSV → see charts"), MerchantMind operates on an autonomous intelligence pipeline:
$$\text{CONNECT} \longrightarrow \text{UNDERSTAND} \longrightarrow \text{MONITOR} \longrightarrow \text{DETECT} \longrightarrow \text{EXPLAIN} \longrightarrow \text{RECOMMEND} \longrightarrow \text{APPROVE} \longrightarrow \text{ACT} \longrightarrow \text{MEASURE}$$

The system answers five fundamental merchant questions continuously:
1. **What is happening?** (Real-time operational cash, receivables, sales, inventory velocity)
2. **What is going wrong / at risk?** (Impending liquidity cliff, dead stock lockup, overdue khata)
3. **Why is it happening?** (Transparent deterministic financial attribution with exact source records)
4. **How much money is affected?** (Quantified exposure: e.g., ₹45,000 supplier cliff vs ₹40,607 cash gap)
5. **What should the merchant do next?** (Ranked, actionable options with trade-offs, executable in 1 click)

---

## 2. USER JOURNEY (MERCHANT)
1. **Morning Briefing:** Alok opens MerchantMind on mobile or desktop; sees executive summary ("Short-term liquidity pressure detected within 5 days").
2. **Contextual Clarity:** Sees his ₹40,607 cash deficit linked directly to a ₹45,000 Sharma Telecom distributor invoice due on Friday.
3. **Evidence Drilldown:** Clicks "Inspect Evidence" to view the supplier bill, current cash trajectory, and ₹3,700 trapped in 38-day overdue customer khata.
4. **Actionable Resolution:** Reviews three ranked actions:
   - Action A: Send automated WhatsApp payment reminders with instant UPI paylinks to 2 overdue customers (Expected: ₹3,700 recovered).
   - Action B: Run a 48-hour flash clearance on dead stock (iPhone 11 cases & legacy tempered glass, unlock ₹10,660).
   - Action C: Request supplier bill split / 7-day payment extension.
5. **Simulated Execution:** Alok approves Action A and B; watches execution status transition to "Executing" -> "Active" -> "Simulated Outcome Measured".
6. **Audit & Closure:** Audit trail records approval timestamp, simulated delivery, and balance adjustment.

## 9. DEMO-DATA ARCHITECTURE
- Single Source of Truth: `src/mock/demoData.ts`
- Deterministic Math Verification:
  - Total Receivables = $\sum$ `ReceivableRecord.amount` = ₹43,200
  - Overdue Receivables (>30 days) = ₹3,700 (INV-REC-101: ₹2,200 + INV-REC-103: ₹1,500)
  - Upcoming Supplier Cliff (Next 5 days) = ₹45,000 (Sharma Telecom Distributor, BILL-SUP-201)
  - Current Available Cash = ₹40,607
  - Liquidity Gap = $₹40,607 - ₹45,000 = -₹4,393$
  - Dead Stock Capital Locked = ₹10,660 (iPhone 11 rugged cases: ₹6,000 + OnePlus 7 screen protectors: ₹4,660)
  - Potential Capital Recovery through Recommended Actions = $₹3,700 (\text{Khata recovery}) + ₹7,800 (\text{Discounted Dead Stock}) = ₹11,500$, turning deficit -₹4,393 into surplus +₹7,107!
- All domain services read from this unified immutable store or cloned reactive state for actions.

---

## 12. OPPORTUNITY / ACTION LIFECYCLE
$$\text{Detected} \longrightarrow \text{Reviewed} \longrightarrow \text{Action Proposed} \longrightarrow \text{Awaiting Approval} \longrightarrow \text{Approved} \longrightarrow \text{Executing (Simulated)} \longrightarrow \text{Completed} \longrightarrow \text{Outcome Measured}$$
- Each state change is tracked in local reactive state with simulated execution logs and before/after metric deltas.

---

## 13. TUTORIAL & HELP STRUCTURE
- **Interactive Tour:** Step-by-step spotlight on:
  1. Executive Summary $\rightarrow$ 2. Liquidity Cliff $\rightarrow$ 3. Opportunity Card $\rightarrow$ 4. Evidence Inspection $\rightarrow$ 5. Action Approval $\rightarrow$ 6. Data Ingestion Pipeline.
- **Knowledge Base:** 6 short guide cards on working capital ratios, Khata recovery tips, inventory turnover, and data privacy.

---

## 14. ARCHITECTURE VISUALIZATION PLAN
- Interactive SVG / Canvas-quality CSS diagram illustrating:
  - Ingestion Layer (Payment Gateways, POS, Accounting, Khata)
  - Canonical Data Engine (Normalization, Deduplication, Validation Quarantine)
  - Deterministic Intelligence Layer (Ratios, Working Capital Cliff, Ageing Rules)
  - Action & Decision Layer (Risk/Reward evaluation, Approval Guardrails)
  - Future Extensible AI/ML Node (Propensity scoring, Seasonal sales forecasting)

---

## 15. RESPONSIVE STRATEGY
- Breakpoints: Desktop (`1280px+`), Laptop (`1024px-1279px`), Tablet (`768px-1023px`), Mobile (`<768px`).
- Tables feature horizontal scroll wrappers with sticky headers or transform into touch-friendly cards on mobile.
- Modals scale to full-height sheets on mobile screens.

---

## 16. DESIGN SYSTEM
- **Visual Aesthetic:** Premium B2B Fintech SaaS (Stripe/Mercury precision, clean borders, high data density, zero tacky AI neon).
- **Backgrounds:** Slate-50 / Gray-50 neutral base, pure white `#FFFFFF` cards, crisp `#E2E8F0` borders.
- **Radius:** `rounded-lg` (8px) for buttons/inputs, `rounded-xl` (12px) for cards, `rounded-2xl` for modals.
- **Shadows:** Subtle layered shadows (`shadow-sm`, `shadow-md` on hover).

---

## 17. TYPOGRAPHY
- **Primary Font:** Inter / Outfit system font stack with fallback to standard modern sans-serif.
- **Financial Numerals:** Tabular numbers (`font-mono` / `tabular-nums`) for currency, percentages, invoice amounts, and tables.
- **Hierarchy:** H1 (24-28px SemiBold), H2 (18-20px SemiBold), Subheading (14px Medium Slate-500), Body (13-14px Slate-700), Micro (11-12px Slate-500).

---

## 18. COLOR SYSTEM
- **Neutral:** Slate-900 (Headings), Slate-700 (Body), Slate-500 (Muted), Slate-200 (Borders), Slate-100 (Secondary BG), Slate-50 (App Canvas).
- **Primary Brand:** Indigo-600 `#4F46E5` / Blue-600 `#2563EB` (Actionable elements, active tabs).
- **Success / Positive:** Emerald-600 `#059669` / Emerald-50 (Healthy cashflow, completed actions, verified data).
- **Warning / Caution:** Amber-600 `#D97706` / Amber-50 (Expiring stock, ageing receivables).
- **Critical / Risk:** Rose-600 `#E11D48` / Rose-50 (Cash deficit, overdue cliff, supplier payment pressure).
- **Paytm Accent:** Cyan-600 `#0284C7` (Used cleanly within the ecosystem connection badges).

---

## 19. CHART STRATEGY
- Clean, performant, SVG/Canvas based charts using lightweight Recharts or custom reactive SVG charts.
- Cashflow Line + Area chart with shaded threshold baseline.
- Khata Ageing horizontal distribution bar.
- Inventory Velocity vs Capital scatter/bar breakdown.
- Always include tooltips with exact currency formatted values (`₹X,XXX`).

---

## 20. ANIMATION STRATEGY
- Micro-interactions only: 150-200ms ease-out transitions for buttons, card hovers, drawer slide-ins, and modal fades.
- No distracting continuous loops or heavy 3D transforms.

---

## 21. LOADING / ERROR / EMPTY STATES
- Standardized `SkeletonCard`, `SkeletonTable`, `EmptyState` with illustration and direct call-to-action, and `ErrorBanner` with retry button.

---

## 22. FRONTEND-TO-BACKEND REPLACEMENT STRATEGY
- Every page queries abstract service interfaces (`IMerchantService`, `IOpportunityService`, `IConnectionService`).
- Services are injected via React Context (`DataProvider`).
- When backend is ready, swapping `new MockOpportunityService()` with `new HttpOpportunityService('/api/v1')` requires zero changes to UI components.

---

## 23. SCREENSHOT & DEMO STRATEGY FOR HACKATHON
- High-contrast, beautifully balanced layouts designed for presentation slides.
- Pre-loaded with rich, realistic Indian retail merchant data (real phone accessories, realistic GST numbers, authentic names).

---

## 24. IMPLEMENTATION PHASES
- **Phase 1:** Project Scaffolding, Design System Foundation, App Shell, Domain Types, Mock Data Store & Provider.
- **Phase 2:** Public Showcase & Product Story (Hero, Architecture, Paytm Ecosystem, How It Works).
